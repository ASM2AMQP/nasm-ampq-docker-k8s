please check that the whole workflow is implemented:

AMQP Producer:

Connect to broker

Create channel

Declare exchange (topic type)

Publish message to exchange with routing key

AMQP Consumer:

Connect to broker

Create channel

Declare exchange (topic type)

Declare queue

Bind queue to exchange with routing key

Consume messages from queue
